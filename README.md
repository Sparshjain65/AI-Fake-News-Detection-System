# 📰 Fake News Detection System (AI + NLP + Machine Learning)

This repository contains an **AI-powered Fake News Detection System** built using **Python**, **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, and **Machine Learning**. The model classifies news articles as **Real** or **Fake** based on textual patterns.

---

## 🔍 Features

* Cleans and preprocesses raw text data
* Converts text into numerical vectors using **TF-IDF**
* Uses **Logistic Regression** for classification
* Provides detailed evaluation metrics
* Includes confusion matrix visualization for performance analysis

---

## 📁 Dataset

The model uses a labeled fake news dataset containing news articles and their corresponding authenticity labels.
(Add your dataset link here if you host it in the repository.)

---

## 🧠 Technologies Used

* Python
* Pandas, NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib, Seaborn
* NLP (TF-IDF Vectorization)

---

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fake-news-detection.git
   ```
2. Install required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the script or open the notebook:

   ```bash
   python fake_news_detection.py
   ```
4. View results such as accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix.

---

## 📊 Results

* High model accuracy (approx. 90% depending on dataset)
* Precision, recall, and F1-score for both fake and real news
* Confusion matrix heatmap for visual evaluation

---

## 📝 Conclusion

This project shows how AI and NLP can effectively detect misinformation by analyzing textual patterns in news articles. It provides a strong baseline for fake news classification.

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

* Add deep learning models (LSTM, BERT, etc.)
* Deploy as a web app or API
* Integrate real-time news scraping
